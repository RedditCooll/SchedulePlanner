# SchedulePlanner

This project is currently for personal test purposes, using popular kits to implement some common website scenarios. 
The goal of the project would be a schedule planning tool, can view and edit some content on the website.  
SchedulePlanner uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

##### frontend:
* [Angular] - The modern web developer's platform.
* [NgZorro] - An enterprise-class Angular UI component library based on Ant Design.
* [Handsontable] - It provides data binding, data validation, filtering, sorting and more.
* [CKEditor5] - CKEditor 5 Builds are a set of ready-to-use rich text editors.
* [ngx-charts] - Declarative Charting Framework for Angular2 and beyond!

##### backend:
* [Springboot] - Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
